# RESPONSIVENESS DEALING WITH TEXT

## SETTING HEIGHT MORE DINAMICALLY

1. **JavaScript-based adjustments**: Use JavaScript to dynamically read the content length and adjust styles or layout accordingly. This is especially useful if you want to make significant layout adjustments based on content length.

   Example:
   ```javascript
   const containers = document.querySelectorAll('.text-container');
   containers.forEach(container => {
       const length = container.innerText.length;
       if (length > 800) {
           container.style.fontSize = 'smaller';
           // other adjustments
       }
   });
   ```

2. **CSS Overflow**: If it's acceptable to truncate or hide portions of the content, you can use CSS properties like `overflow: hidden`, `text-overflow: ellipsis`, or add a gradient fade-out effect at the bottom of containers. This can keep your layout consistent regardless of content length.

3. **Equal Height Columns**: If you're displaying content in a grid or a carousel and you want all items to have the same height regardless of their content length, you can use techniques like Flexbox's `align-items: stretch` or Grid's `align-content: stretch` to ensure all containers stretch to the height of the tallest item.

4. **Dynamic Font Size**: There are JavaScript libraries that can dynamically adjust the font size based on the container's size and content length. For example, libraries like [FitText](https://github.com/davatron5000/FitText.js) make font-sizes flexible. 

5. **Content Guidelines**: Sometimes, the simplest solution is to have content guidelines. For instance, if you're pulling content from a database, you might set guidelines for content creators to keep summaries or descriptions within a certain character limit.

6. **Hybrid Approaches**: Often, a combination of the above strategies is used. For example, a site might use CSS to handle minor variations in content length but employ JavaScript to make larger layout adjustments for more significant variations.

7. **Adaptive Design**: Instead of trying to force content into a fixed design, you can create designs that adapt to the content. This might mean using more vertical space for longer content, or designing elements that look good regardless of whether they're filled with a little bit of content or a lot.

The best approach depends on the specific requirements of your project and the user experience you're aiming for. It's always a good idea to test different solutions with real-world content to see which one works best in practice.

## SETTING UP FIXED HEIGHT

Given:
- Average characters per text: 200.
- Average word length: 5 characters (plus a space).
- That gives us roughly 33 words.
- Ideally, we want around 10-15 words per line for good readability.

For brevity and to provide more room for error, we can assume:

1. On small mobile devices, we'll have about 10 words per line (so around 3-4 lines of text).
2. On larger screens, we'll have about 15 words per line (so around 2-3 lines of text).

AVG CHARACTERS PER WORD-> IDEALLY FROM 5 TO 7
AVG WORDS PER LINE -> IDEALLY FROM 10 TO 15
TOTAL WORDS: TOTAL CHARACTERS / AVG CHARACTERS PER WORD
AVERAGE NUMBER OF LINES: TOTAL WORDS / AVG WORDS PER LINE 
HEIGHT = (fontsize * line-height) * AVERAGE NUMBER OF LINES

SO IF WANT TO FIX THE HEIGHT BASED ON AVERAGE CHARACTERS FOUND IN OUR DATASET OF TEXT WE NEED TO DINAMICALLY SET THE HEIGHT AND APPLY THE BELOW SET OF RULES

HERE THE HEIGHT THAT WE WOULD SET WOULD BE STATIC BASED ON AVERAGE TEXT LENGHT 

Here's the CSS:

```css

.text-container {
    --avg-word-length: 6; /* Average characters per word, including space */
    --total-chars: 600; /* Total number of characters in the text */
    --words-per-line: 13;

    --chars-per-line: calc(var(--words-per-line) * var(--avg-word-length));

    --num-lines: calc(var(--total-chars) / var(--chars-per-line));

    width: 80%; 
    font-size: 16px; 
    line-height: 1.6; 
    height: calc(var(--num-lines) * 1.6em); /* Assuming 1.6em is the line height */
    overflow-wrap: break-word;
}

.text-container {
    width: 80%; /* Set to 80% of parent width */
    font-size: 16px; /* Default font size */
    line-height: 1.6; /* Slightly increased line height for better spacing */
    overflow-wrap: break-word; /* Break long words if necessary */
}

/* Mobile (Small) */
@media only screen and (max-width: 320px) {
    .text-container {
        font-size: 14px; 
        line-height: 1.5;
    }
}

/* Mobile (General) */
@media only screen and (max-width: 480px) {
    .text-container {
        font-size: 15px;
    }
}

/* Mobile (Large)/Tablet (Small) */
@media only screen and (max-width: 768px) {
    .text-container {
        font-size: 16px;
    }
}

/* Tablet (General) */
@media only screen and (max-width: 992px) {
    .text-container {
        font-size: 17px;
    }
}

/* Desktop (Small) */
@media only screen and (max-width: 1024px) {
    .text-container {
        font-size: 18px;
    }
}

/* Desktop (Medium) */
@media only screen and (max-width: 1200px) {
    .text-container {
        font-size: 19px;
    }
}

/* Desktop (Large) */
@media only screen and (max-width: 1440px) {
    .text-container {
        font-size: 20px;
    }
}

/* Desktop (Extra Large) */
@media only screen and (min-width: 1600px) {
    .text-container {
        font-size: 21px;
    }
}
```
### STATISTICS USED FOR THIS SET OF RULES CREATED ABOVE
 
 It's tough to give a definitive set of values since there are so many variables in play (like design, font choice, user settings, browser defaults, etc.), here are some broader statistics and recommendations based on browser usage, device usage, and general design principles:

1. Browser Market Share (as of the last known data from 2022):

Chrome: ~65%
Safari: ~19%
Edge: ~4%
Firefox: ~3.5%
Others: ~8.5%
2. Device Screen Resolutions (Popular ones as of 2022):

Mobile:
Small: 320px (e.g., iPhone SE)
Medium: 375px (e.g., iPhone X, iPhone 11 Pro)
Large: 414px (e.g., iPhone 11 Pro Max)
X-Large: 480px and above (some Android phones)
Tablet:
Small: 768px (e.g., iPad)
Large: 1024px (e.g., iPad Pro)
Desktop:
1280px (smaller laptops)
1366px (most common laptop size)
1440px
1536px and 1920px (Full HD)
2560px and above (4K)
3. Font-Size Recommendations:

Mobile (320-480px): 14-16px for body text.
Tablet (768-1024px): 16-18px for body text.
Desktop (1024px and above): 18-21px for body text.
4. Line-height Recommendations:

Aim for a line-height of 1.5x the font size for optimal readability.
5. Font Choice:

Serif fonts (like Times New Roman) can be harder to read on screens, especially at smaller sizes.
Sans-serif fonts (like Arial, Helvetica, or Roboto) are generally better for screen readability.
6. Other Recommendations:

Use font-smoothing or -webkit-font-smoothing for improved font rendering on some browsers.
Limit line length to 50-75 characters for optimal readability.
Ensure a good contrast ratio between text and background.
Avoid using very light text on a very dark background or vice versa. It can cause eye strain.
Remember, these are general guidelines. The best way to determine the optimal design for your specific audience is through user testing and feedback. Additionally, continually keeping an eye on updated browser and device statistics will help in making informed design decisions.

#### Why limiting length to 50-75 chars?

Limiting the line length in typography refers to the number of characters, including spaces, on a single line of text. The recommendation to keep it between 50-75 characters is based on readability research and has been a standard typographic practice for quite some time. Here's why:

Eye Fatigue: Longer lines of text can cause eye fatigue. As the eye moves from the end of one line to the beginning of the next, there's a higher chance of losing one's place if the line is too long.

Reading Speed: Even if people can read longer lines without losing their place, it's usually slower because it requires more horizontal eye movement.

Cognitive Load: Shorter line lengths allow the reader to quickly scan the content. Longer lines require more concentration and can increase cognitive load, making it harder to understand and retain the content.

Vertical Rhythm: In web design, especially, shorter line lengths help maintain a consistent vertical rhythm when combined with appropriate line spacing (line-height), aiding overall readability.

Aesthetics: From a design perspective, shorter line lengths are often more visually appealing and harmonious, especially in combination with other elements on a page.

Responsiveness: In web design, shorter line lengths can make it easier to design responsive sites that look good on a variety of devices, from mobile phones to large desktop monitors.

While the 50-75 character range is a general guideline, the exact optimal line length can vary based on factors like font size, font type, line spacing, and the specific content. Some designers might prefer a bit shorter or longer lines in certain contexts. The key is to aim for a balance that enhances readability and comprehension for your audience.


### CALCULATE AVERAGE NUMBER OF LINES TO DETERMIN HEIGHT FOR A TEXT OF 600 CHARACTERS
To estimate the average number of lines for a text that is 600 characters long, you'd use the following steps:

1. **Average Word Length**: Consider the average word length to be around 5 characters (this is a typical estimate, but it can vary based on language and context). This doesn't account for spaces; if you add a space after each word, it becomes 6 characters per word on average.

2. **Words in the Text**: 
\[
\frac{{\text{{total characters}}}}{{\text{{average characters per word}}}} = \frac{{600}}{{6}} = 100 \text{{ words}}
\]

So, the text is approximately 100 words.

3. **Words per Line**: This depends on the font size, container width, and the specific words (since some words are longer than others). But as a general rule, based on our previous discussion on limiting line length to 50-75 characters for optimal readability, let's take an average of 60 characters per line. This would mean about 10 words per line (using our average of 6 characters per word including spaces).

4. **Total Number of Lines**:
\[
\frac{{\text{{total words}}}}{{\text{{words per line}}}} = \frac{{100}}{{10}} = 10 \text{{ lines}}
\]

So, for a text that's 600 characters long, you might expect it to span around 10 lines, given the assumptions we've made. Again, this is a rough estimate and the actual number could vary based on the specific content, font used, container width, and other styling factors.
